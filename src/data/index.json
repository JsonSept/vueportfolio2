        "Hello my name is Jason September ,I am 25 years old. I like to be on the road and not at home ,I like going to new places and meeting new people. I also like discovering new restaurants and trying out their foods. I like to work out and keep myself fit whenever I am not too lazy. I love watching anime and I don't think that will stop anytime soon.",
        "I never knew much about computers on school ,only found my fascination for it late in my life but not too late to persue a career in the tech industry.I have done coding online through CodeSpace and that's where I started as an Aspiring Developer .I am stil very inexperienced when it comes to coding but more than willing to learn so that I can better myself ,my knowledge and my understanding of how code works."
